Automated Daily Email Notifications (Cron Job)
This application includes a daily email reminder feature that notifies users of any pending tasks due on that day. The system utilizes Laravel’s Scheduler and a Cron Job to automate the process.

Overview
Purpose: The scheduled task identifies users with pending tasks due on the current day and sends them an email reminder.
Automation: This process runs automatically each day, ensuring users receive timely notifications about their tasks.
Setting Up the Cron Job
Define the Command: A custom command has been created in the application to find users with pending tasks and queue email reminders for them.

Schedule the Command: Within the application, the command is set to run daily using Laravel’s scheduling functionality.

Configure a Server-Side Cron Job:

To activate the Laravel scheduler, add a Cron Job on the server to run the scheduler every minute. This setup allows Laravel to check every minute if there are scheduled tasks to run, including the daily reminder.
Running the Command Manually
For testing, the command can be executed manually. Running it this way immediately triggers the email reminders, simulating the daily Cron Job functionality and allowing you to verify that the emails are sent correctly.

Using Queues for Efficient Email Delivery
To avoid delaying the main application while sending emails, the app uses queues for email delivery:

Queue Driver: The .env configuration specifies a queue driver that supports the queue system.
Worker: The application requires a queue worker to process the email jobs. In production, this worker can be managed using a process manager to run continuously in the background.
Testing the Cron Job
After setting up the Cron Job:

Run the command manually to verify that emails are sent as expected.
Check the email queue (if using a database driver) to ensure the pending emails are correctly queued.
Review logs for any issues with the job execution or email delivery.
This automated email notification system ensures users are consistently reminded to complete their pending tasks, enhancing productivity and user experience.
